"""The network's internal-traffic contract — the analytics point of truth.

The rule (https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics, "Internal traffic"): a
request whose User-Agent contains `2plot-internal` is 2plot machinery talking
to itself — the hub's hourly health sweep, CI smoke batteries, the 4x-daily
heartbeat, cross-app calls — and is counted NOWHERE. Dropped at write time,
before device detection and before bot classification. `/healthz` is never a
visit either.

Both halves are tested here, because a contract kept on only one side is not
kept at all:

*inbound*   token-carrying requests never reach the ledger, and therefore
            never reach `human_hits` / `bot_hits` in the hourly rollup this
            app POSTs to 2plot.ai;
*outbound*  every call this host makes to another network host sends
            `INTERNAL_UA`, so the far side can apply the same rule. That half
            was missing: the ad client fetched a campaign from 2plot.dev on
            every single docs page view, arriving as `python-requests/2.x`,
            and the hub counted this satellite's readers as its own bots.
