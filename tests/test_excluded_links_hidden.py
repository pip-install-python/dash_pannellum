"""Admin pages hide from BOTH audiences — the llms-2plot-dev footgun, kept.

Before 1.6.8, a path hidden from the sidebar (then `excluded_links`) stayed
in sitemap.xml, /llms.txt, the tier corpora, MCP and the prerender; a fork
"hid" the template's tutorials and kept publishing them to every crawler
as its own documentation. 1.6.38 deleted `excluded_links` (the sidebar is
built from frontmatter now) — what remains hidden-by-rule is `/admin/*`,
and this suite pins the parity from both ends: the mechanism (every admin
path is in dimll's hidden state) and the surfaces (none appears in the
sitemap or /llms.txt, none in the sidebar tree, while a control page does
— so an empty sitemap can never pass this vacuously).
