"""The shipped .claude/ development kit — the F1 fabric build (2026-08-24).

The kit is how every fork inherits the network's behavioral contract,
skills, and settings. These pins keep it shipped (the old blanket
`.claude/` ignore silently kept the project instructions local-only —
forks inherited NOTHING), keep it case-correct (macOS is
case-insensitive; the fleet's CI and Render are not), and keep each
fork's settings pointing at ITS OWN host rather than the template's.
