"""Shared fixtures — boot the real app once, then interrogate it.

The suite deliberately exercises `run.py` itself rather than a stripped-down
app assembled for testing. Nearly everything worth catching here lives in the
wiring: registration order, which middleware runs first, whether a page's
prose survived to the response. A test app that re-implements that wiring
tests the re-implementation.

Backend selection follows `DASH_BACKEND`, so the same suite runs against
Flask, FastAPI and Quart in CI. `client` normalises the three test clients
behind `.get(path, user_agent=...) -> (status, text)`.

SECRETLESS, AND ORDER MATTERS. The suite runs against the app exactly as CI's
zero-secret container does: no Clerk keys (auth falls open, non-public tiers
still deny), no `CROSS_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (the hub client reports itself
disabled and the traffic reporter never starts a thread), and the analytics
ledger in a temp dir. The zero-secret boot is itself the first invariant —
every fail-closed assertion in tests/test_access.py depends on it.

The env block below therefore has to run BEFORE anything imports `run.py`,
because `lib/backend.py` calls `load_dotenv()` during that import and a
developer's local `.env` would otherwise flip the app into a configured
posture. `load_dotenv()` never overrides an existing key, so pinning each
secret to `""` here (falsy to every `os.getenv(...) or None` reader in `lib/`)
neutralises the file without deleting it. In CI there is no `.env` at all and
this is belt-and-braces. Same pattern as 2plotai and pip-docs+.
