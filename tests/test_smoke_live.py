    This host DOES have a post() now (template 1.6.29 item 6, ported
    2026-08-26 with the auth-wiring and head-parity blocks), so the pin is
    no longer just a net for a file that might grow one: it guards the
    exact call flexlayout found naked. Both urlopens — fetch()'s GET and
    post()'s auth probe — must carry the context, and this sweeps every
    one the file grows next (template 1.6.16 item 7).
