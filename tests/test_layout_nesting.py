"""No page layout nests a list directly inside a children list.

THE DEFECT (modelviewer, found on the wire 2026-08-30, reported by the
ops seat): a page composed its layout as

    children=[hero, create_parser(...)(content)]

markdown2dash's parser returns a **list**, so that expression puts a
list *inside* a children list. Dash does not descend into a nested
list — React logs #31 and the page subtree renders EMPTY while the app
shell around it looks perfectly healthy. The suite was green. Every
smoke check was green. The page was blank.

WHY NOTHING SAW IT: the prerender is built from the MARKDOWN, so every
machine-lane check reads a fine document while the browser lane is
empty — item 17's lane split, one layer up. The only surface that shows
it is a browser, which is why this is a pin and not a review note.

Adopted from emojimart (44ae41b), which reproduces modelviewer's
failing path character for character; the positive-control page is
derived from the registry here rather than named.
