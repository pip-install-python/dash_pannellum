"""CD promotes main → release on a green matrix; nothing else writes release.

The road since 1.6.35 (owner decision A, 2026-08-29): Render auto-deploys
the `release` branch and ONLY cd.yml's `deploy` job writes it, as a
fast-forward push of the run's own sha after the CI matrix is green. The
measurement behind it: 14:12Z that day, de0bcff pushed to main; Render,
watching main, built it within the minute; its CD run went red at 14:13Z
with the deploy job skipped; /healthz served the red build for ~6 minutes.
CI cannot stop a deploy while the platform watches the branch CI is still
judging.

These pins hold the STRUCTURE — the part a fork can drift silently:
`deploy` still needs `test`; the promote step exists and is not a force
push; the write grant is on that one job, not the workflow; the hook
step is gone; render.yaml watches `release`.
