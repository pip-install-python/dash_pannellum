"""The docs/ sweep — 1.6.44 item 7.

`.flake8` excludes `docs/*/`, so a lint over the repository says nothing
about the Python a documentation site actually renders — and on THIS repo
those files are the `.. exec::` examples that build the showcase for the
component the repo itself ships, so the gap sat over the pages the site
exists for. `py_compile` reads
those files; CI runs it as a named step. This module holds the step to its
name and the corpus to being non-empty.
