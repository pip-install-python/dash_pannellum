"""The social card and the installable-app surfaces.

TEMPLATE FILE: satellites copy this and change only the constants it imports.

Both things tested here fail silently and fail OUTSIDE the app, which is why
they need tests rather than a look at the page — nobody sees their own unfurls,
and no browser explains why it declined to offer an install.

The two failures this repo actually shipped, both found during the 2plot
network rollout:

1. **A duplicate og:image, one of them an SVG.** `templates/index.html`
   declared og:image and twitter:image statically, while Dash ALSO emits both
   per page (`dash/_pages.py`). With no `image_url=` passed, Dash inferred one
   from the assets folder, found `assets/logo.svg`, and emitted it alongside
   the static tag. Social scrapers reject SVG, and the inferred tag came last,
   so the carefully-described card lost to an image nothing can render.

2. **An inert manifest.** The icon set shipped in `assets/favicon/`, but the
   manifest and apple-touch-icon links were commented out with a note saying
   the files were missing — a note that outlived the files' arrival — and the
   commented-out hrefs pointed one directory too high anyway. The manifest
   itself still carried another site's name, copied in from dash-email, which
   is what an install prompt would have shown had one ever been offered.

Note where each tag comes from, because it decides which file to open when one
of these fails: `og:image`, `twitter:image` and the `twitter:*` set are DASH's
(per page, from `register_page`); `og:site_name`, the `og:image:*` auxiliaries
and the icon links are `templates/index.html`'s. dash-improve-my-llms adds a
third set, but only on the prerender path, which social scrapers do not take —
its bot list has `facebookbot` (Meta's AI training crawler), not
`facebookexternalhit` (the link-preview fetcher). That is why deleting
index.html would silently kill every unfurl.
