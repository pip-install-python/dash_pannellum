"""Smoke battery for a 2plot satellite — CI container and production alike.

One script, two seats, the SAME named checks either way, so a failure in CI
and a failure against production read identically:

    CI container   python scripts/network_smoke.py --base-url http://localhost:8561
    Production     python scripts/network_smoke.py --base-url https://pannellum.2plot.dev

Stdlib-only on purpose: CI runs it from the host against the booted container
with a bare `python3`, before anything is pip-installed.

This is a TEMPLATE FILE. Every satellite forked from this repo copies it
verbatim and changes only the block marked "per-site" below — the expected
H1, the port, the paths that must 404. Everything else is the network
standard; if a check here is wrong, it is wrong on twenty hosts.

What a satellite is to the network is what the battery proves: that it states
its identity, that its agent-facing document surfaces are real, that it runs
the intended dash-improve-my-llms artifact, and that no owner-only surface
leaks. A satellite holds no key material, so unlike the hub's copy of this
script there is no agent-key API to fail closed — the corresponding check
here is that this host's llms.txt points *back* at the hub that does.

Every UA this script sends carries the internal-traffic token (the analytics
point of truth — https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics, "Internal
traffic"): a battery must never register as a visitor or a "bot" in any
network ledger. Even the deliberately crawler-shaped probe appends the token
— the target still exercises its bot path, but its analytics know the caller
is machinery.

Exit code: 1 if any check fails, else 0.

        `/healthz` alone with one UA is not the test, and on THIS host that
        is not hypothetical: measured 2026-09-05 at dimll 2.8.0, `/healthz`
        405'd to HEAD on all three UAs while `/` returned 405 to a browser
        and 200 to a crawler — the prerender answering before the router.
        A single-UA check reads green on exactly that host. Five paths,
        three UAs, and the pair count is asserted so a lane that silently
        stopped being probed cannot pass.

        WHAT THIS ROW MEASURES THROUGH A CDN, stated because the two
        readings disagreed on the day it was written. In-process on this
        tree, dimll 2.8.0, the fastapi lane gave 11/15. The same battery
        against https://pannellum.2plot.dev gave 15/15 — through Cloudflare
        (`server: cloudflare`, `x-render-origin-server: uvicorn`). Either
        the edge answered the HEAD without the origin's 405 reaching it, or
        production's wheel already carries 2.9.4's route-level HEAD. THIS
        SEAT CANNOT TELL THOSE APART: no wire surface named the package
        version when the measurement was taken.

        So this row asserts what a CLIENT sees, which is worth asserting and
        is not the same claim as "the app answers HEAD". The app-level
        assertion lives in tests/test_head_parity.py, in-process, where no
        edge can stand in for the router.

        THE DISCRIMINATOR IS OWED AND IS NOW ONE GET: `llms_version` on
        /healthz (1.6.44 item 1, shipped in this same round). Read it after
        the push — >= 2.9.4 means the origin has route-level HEAD and the
        edge was innocent; 2.8.x or 2.9.2 means the edge was masking an
        origin that 405s, and the shim ported in item 2 is load-bearing on
