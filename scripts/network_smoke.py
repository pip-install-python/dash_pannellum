"""Smoke battery for a 2plot satellite — CI container and production alike.

One script, two seats, the SAME named checks either way, so a failure in CI
and a failure against production read identically:

    CI container   python scripts/network_smoke.py --base-url http://localhost:8561
    Production     python scripts/network_smoke.py --base-url https://pannellum.2plot.dev

Stdlib-only on purpose: CI runs it from the host against the booted container
with a bare `python3`, before anything is pip-installed.

This is a TEMPLATE FILE. Every satellite forked from this repo copies it
verbatim and changes only the block marked "per-site" below — the expected
H1, the port, the paths that must 404. Everything else is the network
standard; if a check here is wrong, it is wrong on twenty hosts.

What a satellite is to the network is what the battery proves: that it states
its identity, that its agent-facing document surfaces are real, that it runs
the intended dash-improve-my-llms artifact, and that no owner-only surface
leaks. A satellite holds no key material, so unlike the hub's copy of this
script there is no agent-key API to fail closed — the corresponding check
here is that this host's llms.txt points *back* at the hub that does.

Every UA this script sends carries the internal-traffic token (the analytics
point of truth — https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics, "Internal
traffic"): a battery must never register as a visitor or a "bot" in any
network ledger. Even the deliberately crawler-shaped probe appends the token
— the target still exercises its bot path, but its analytics know the caller
is machinery.

Exit code: 1 if any check fails, else 0.
