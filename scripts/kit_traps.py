"""Count the fleet-class traps in a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` traps section.

1.6.44 item 14 (emojimart 166e33a). A fork's traps section can sit fifteen
entries behind the template's — 7 against 22 on emojimart, whose HEAD trap
still carried the diagnosis 1.6.32 had corrected. The kit is contract-class,
so the sync never copied it, and nothing printed the gap.

This prints the PAIR. Run it with two paths and it reports
`fork N / template M` plus the titles the fork is missing, which is what the
fan-out needs per fork; run it with one and it reports that file's count.

Matching is by the first sentence of each entry, lower-cased and squeezed —
NOT by exact text, because a fork is expected to have merged a trap into its
own wording and adding a host-specific clause must not read as absence. That
is deliberately generous: the check exists to find a fork that never
received a trap, not to police prose.
