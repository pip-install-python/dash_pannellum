"""Sample the wire and the CD run state on ONE timeline, across a promote.

The concrete form of trap 3(a) (1.6.44 item 17; pannellum 15917bc,
modelviewer 540926a, emojimart 166e33a, clerkhook f1481f5). It answers one
question — does Render react to the PUSH or to the PROMOTE? — and it answers
it on a green push, without waiting for a red one.

Three things this does that a hand-written watcher gets wrong:

1. ONE LOOP, ONE TIMELINE. The wire and the run state are sampled in the
   same iteration. Two separate reconstructions invite exactly the
   arithmetic error the measurement exists to avoid.

2. TIMES AGAINST THE PROMOTE STEP'S `completed_at`, never the deploy JOB's.
   The job CONTAINS the build-match wait, so it completes when the wait SEES
   the swap: it tracks the swap and never the promote, and landed at -13 s
   and 0 s on the template's two measured pairs. Useless for timing either
   way.

3. RETRIES EACH SAMPLE THREE TIMES and records `unreadable` as a state
   DISTINCT from `old`. The container restart lands exactly where the
   bracket needs its sample — twice out of two on this host — so an
   un-retried loop is systematically blind at the only moment that matters,
   and collapsing unreadable into old invents a bracket nobody observed.

The result is STRONG EVIDENCE, never proof: a queued or slow build could in
principle produce the same shape. The canonical discriminator is still the
first push that goes RED on main leaving `release` unmoved and the wire
unchanged.

THIS HOST HAS NOT YET TAKEN THE MEASUREMENT, and its own kit says why the
opportunity has been missed three times: `main == release == wire` at every
step of a promote tells you NOTHING, because both refs hold the same sha and
the wire cannot separate them. Three promotes here said nothing at all. The
sampler exists so the next one does not — run it FROM THE MOMENT OF THE PUSH
and read the bracket against the PROMOTE. Until then this repo's
`render.yaml: branch: release` remains documentation, and the host may still
be building from main.
