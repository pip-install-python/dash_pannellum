"""Client for the network hub's agent-key and page-tier endpoints.

Three calls, all satellite → hub, never browser → hub::

    POST {hub}/api/agent-key/current   -> {"key": "k2p_..."}   for the copy button
    POST {hub}/api/agent-key/verify    -> {"verdict": ..., "ttl": ...}
    POST {hub}/api/page-tiers          -> {"tiers": {path: tier}, "ttl": ...}

Why a hub call exists at all
----------------------------
A signed-in visitor is resolved **locally** by Clerk and never reaches this
module. Only an agent fetch does: someone pastes a document URL into an
assistant, and it arrives with no cookie, carrying `?key=` instead. Only the
hub can validate that key, because only the hub holds the secret it was
derived from.

That asymmetry is the point of the design. A satellite holds **no key
material** — it cannot mint, and it cannot verify offline. Sharing the hub's
`SESSION_SECRET` would let any satellite verify locally, but anything that can
verify can also mint, including `scope=admin`; twenty deployments holding a
network-wide admin-minting secret is precisely the failure this avoids.

Authenticating the caller
-------------------------
The hub must know which satellite is asking — a verify endpoint open to the
internet is a key-guessing oracle. This reuses the network's existing
signed-webhook scheme (`CROSS_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, HMAC-SHA256 over
`"{timestamp}." + body`), the same one `lib/satellite_reporter` already uses.
That secret authenticates a caller; it does not derive keys, so holding it
grants a satellite nothing it could not already do.

Failure behaviour
-----------------
Every failure path — no secret, timeout, DNS, 5xx, non-JSON, wrong shape —
returns ``gated``. Never ``allow``: a hub outage must not publish restricted
prose. Never ``deny``: an outage must not black-hole every document. ``gated``
leaks nothing and keeps the surface answering, which is the same fail-safe the
package applies when an app's own check raises.

Nothing here logs a key, or anything derived from one.
