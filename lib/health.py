"""
``/healthz`` liveness probe for the Flask and Quart backends.

The 2plot.ai hub sweeps every satellite's ``/healthz`` once an hour and records
up/down + latency — that's the "Satellite health & reach" panel on ``/traffic``
(the traffic rollup this app POSTs supplies the other half). The FastAPI build
already declares a typed ``/healthz`` in ``lib/asgi_routes`` so it shows up in
Swagger; this module gives the other two backends the same endpoint, so the
probe result doesn't depend on which backend a deployment happens to run.

Keep it cheap: the hub measures the round trip, so any work done here is
reported back as this app being slow.
