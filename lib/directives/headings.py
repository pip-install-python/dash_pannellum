"""Heading ids that survive inline formatting — and match their TOC anchors.

Two defects in markdown2dash's heading handling, both hit as soon as a heading
contains anything other than plain text:

1. **`## The `peers` tier` raises `AttributeError`.**
   ``DashRenderer.heading`` does ``create_heading_id(text[0])``, where ``text``
   is the list of *rendered* inline tokens. When the first token is formatted,
   ``text[0]`` is a ``dmc.Code`` / ``dmc.Text`` component rather than a string,
   and ``create_heading_id`` calls ``.lower()`` on it. The whole page fails to
   import, so one backtick in one heading takes the site down at startup.

2. **Formatted headings get an id their own TOC doesn't link to.**
   Even when the first token *is* a string, only that first token becomes the
   id: ``## Wiring **it** up`` renders ``id="wiring"``. Meanwhile the `toc`
   directive slugs the raw markdown source — ``wiring-**it**-up`` — so the
   anchor in the sidebar points at a fragment that exists nowhere on the page.
   Clicking it does nothing, silently.

The fix is one slug function used by both sides: flatten the rendered heading
back to plain text for the id, strip the same inline markers out of the raw
source for the TOC, and the two agree again.

Plain-text headings — every heading in this repo before this module existed —
slug exactly as they did before, so no existing anchor or deep link moves.
