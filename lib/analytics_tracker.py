"""
Visitor Analytics Tracker
Tracks visitor information including device type, bot detection, and geolocation.

This ledger is the raw material for two things:

1. the app's own record of who read the docs, and
2. the hourly rollup this app POSTs to 2plot.ai (``lib/satellite_reporter``),
   which is what the network ``/traffic`` dashboard charts.

Because the hub compares apps side by side, the fields written here match the
hub's own ledger exactly: ``{timestamp, path, device_type, user_agent,
bot_type?, ip_address?, location?}``. Crawler rows (``device_type == "bot"``)
additionally carry ``{vendor_key, vendor_class, verified, lane}`` since
1.6.34; human rows are unchanged.

Since 1.6.34 the same file holds a SECOND table, ``reads``: one row per
corpus document dash-improve-my-llms served, handed to :meth:`record_read`
through the package's ``on_document_read`` hook (2.8.0). ``visits`` is what
the request hook saw; ``reads`` is what the package says it served (tier,
verdict, bytes, verified vendor). They are joined by ``lib/traffic_rollup``
and never summed into each other.

THERE IS ONE CLASSIFIER — ``dash_improve_my_llms.classify()``. This module
carried its own User-Agent lists for a year; they filed ClaudeBot (Anthropic's
*training* crawler) under "search", still named the retired ``anthropic-ai`` /
``claude-web`` tokens, knew nothing of ``bytespider`` or ``Claude-User``, and
counted every UA-less or library client (``httpx``, ``Go-http-client``) as a
person. Every host in the fleet reported those numbers. The lists are gone:
``is_bot`` / ``detect_bot_type`` keep their names for callers and delegate. A
token the registry lacks is a pushback to the package, never a list here —
``tests/test_analytics_classifier.py`` greps this file for the old tokens.

Accuracy notes (these are the things that quietly wreck the numbers):

- **Network machinery is never a visitor.** Any request whose User-Agent
  carries ``lib.constants.INTERNAL_UA_TOKEN`` is dropped in ``track_visit``
  before device detection — the network's internal-traffic contract
  (https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics). ``/healthz`` is dropped there
  too. Both are write-time rules on purpose; see the comment in ``track_visit``.
- **No raw IP is stored** (1.6.44 item 16). The client address is still
  RESOLVED from the proxy headers, because it is needed to tell one visitor
  from another and because ``remote_addr`` behind Cloudflare/Render is the
  proxy — every visitor would otherwise collapse into one. It is then reduced
  to ``visitor_key``, a keyed one-way hash of (address + User-Agent), and the
  address itself is dropped. Set ``ANALYTICS_KEEP_CLIENT_IP=1`` to keep it —
  the same switch ``record_read`` has always honoured.
- **Location comes from the edge, never from a lookup.** Cloudflare's
  ``CF-IPCountry`` answers the country; ``CF-IPCity``, ``CF-Region``,
  ``CF-IPLatitude`` and ``CF-IPLongitude`` answer more when the zone's "Add
  visitor location headers" managed transform is on. Whatever ARRIVES is
  stored; whatever does not is absent. There is no third-party lookup and no
  fallback to one: the ip-api.com path was REMOVED at 1.6.44, not defaulted
  off, because a disabled lookup is one environment variable away from being
  an enabled one.
- **Writes are buffered, locked and pruned.** Multiple gunicorn/uvicorn workers
  share this file; without an ``flock`` around the read-modify-write they
  silently overwrite each other's hits. The buffer keeps a docs site from
  rewriting the whole file on every request, and retention keeps it bounded.

        this drop existed the network's own probes — the hub's hourly health
        sweep, this repo's link audit, every post-deploy battery — landed in
        ``reads`` and were the busiest "vendor" on the board.

        Keyed on ``ua``: ``EVENT_FIELDS`` names it ``ua``, not
        ``user_agent``, and a drop keyed on the wrong name is silently a
        no-op — which is this item's own failure mode, so the field name is
        asserted in tests/test_internal_traffic.py rather than trusted.

    the null classes the fleet measured came from the read-event path
    dropping the key at the app boundary, not from ``classify()`` withholding
    it. The prefer branch below is the live one here and this fallback is
    dormant — kept because it is the right shape for a fork on an older
    wheel, and because it costs nothing when the value is present.
