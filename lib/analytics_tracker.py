"""
Visitor Analytics Tracker
Tracks visitor information including device type, bot detection, and geolocation.

This ledger is the raw material for two things:

1. the app's own record of who read the docs, and
2. the hourly rollup this app POSTs to 2plot.ai (``lib/satellite_reporter``),
   which is what the network ``/traffic`` dashboard charts.

Because the hub compares apps side by side, the fields written here match the
hub's own ledger exactly: ``{timestamp, path, device_type, user_agent,
bot_type?, ip_address?, location?}``. Crawler rows (``device_type == "bot"``)
additionally carry ``{vendor_key, vendor_class, verified, lane}`` since
1.6.34; human rows are unchanged.

Since 1.6.34 the same file holds a SECOND table, ``reads``: one row per
corpus document dash-improve-my-llms served, handed to :meth:`record_read`
through the package's ``on_document_read`` hook (2.8.0). ``visits`` is what
the request hook saw; ``reads`` is what the package says it served (tier,
verdict, bytes, verified vendor). They are joined by ``lib/traffic_rollup``
and never summed into each other.

THERE IS ONE CLASSIFIER — ``dash_improve_my_llms.classify()``. This module
carried its own User-Agent lists for a year; they filed ClaudeBot (Anthropic's
*training* crawler) under "search", still named the retired ``anthropic-ai`` /
``claude-web`` tokens, knew nothing of ``bytespider`` or ``Claude-User``, and
counted every UA-less or library client (``httpx``, ``Go-http-client``) as a
person. Every host in the fleet reported those numbers. The lists are gone:
``is_bot`` / ``detect_bot_type`` keep their names for callers and delegate. A
token the registry lacks is a pushback to the package, never a list here —
``tests/test_analytics_classifier.py`` greps this file for the old tokens.

Accuracy notes (these are the things that quietly wreck the numbers):

- **Network machinery is never a visitor.** Any request whose User-Agent
  carries ``lib.constants.INTERNAL_UA_TOKEN`` is dropped in ``track_visit``
  before device detection — the network's internal-traffic contract
  (https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics). ``/healthz`` is dropped there
  too. Both are write-time rules on purpose; see the comment in ``track_visit``.
- **Client IP** comes from the proxy headers first (``CF-Connecting-IP``,
  ``X-Forwarded-For``, ...). Behind Cloudflare/Render, ``remote_addr`` is the
  *proxy*, so every visitor would collapse into one and geolocation would point
  at a datacenter.
- **Country** prefers Cloudflare's ``CF-IPCountry`` header — free, accurate and
  instant. The ip-api.com lookup is only a fallback (set
  ``ANALYTICS_GEO_LOOKUP=0`` to disable it entirely).
- **Writes are buffered, locked and pruned.** Multiple gunicorn/uvicorn workers
  share this file; without an ``flock`` around the read-modify-write they
  silently overwrite each other's hits. The buffer keeps a docs site from
  rewriting the whole file on every request, and retention keeps it bounded.
