"""Cross-host directory for the 2plot network — one definition, every satellite.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Search engines follow links between hosts weakly; agents don't follow them at
all. A model answering "what does this ecosystem provide?" fetches one or two
URLs and reasons from what came back. Landing on ``leaflet.2plot.dev`` it sees
one library, with nothing in the markup saying the other eleven hosts exist.
``sitemap.xml`` cannot fix that — a sitemap is scoped to its own origin by
design — so ``dash-improve-my-llms`` 2.1 emits an explicit machine-readable
directory instead: ``<link rel="related">`` tags in ``<head>``, a ``## Network``
section in ``/llms.txt``, and followed links in the prerendered body.

Keep the definition **here**, in the template, and import it. Twelve
hand-maintained copies of the same peer list will drift, and a directory that
disagrees with itself across hosts is worse than no directory at all.

Three tiers, and the distinction is load-bearing:

``PEERS``
    Same network, same operator. These build the cross-host graph you own.
``AFFILIATED``
    Yours, on unrelated domains. Findable when asked "what else did you
    build?" without being swept into "what is the 2plot network?".
``EXTERNAL``
    Third-party docs you reference but don't own. Emitted ``rel="nofollow"``
    — references, not endorsements.

Usage in a satellite's ``run.py``, before ``add_llms_routes(app)``::

    from lib.constants import BASE_URL
    from lib import network_directory

    app._base_url = BASE_URL
    network_directory.apply(BASE_URL)

# this list across nine repos; this copy is the canonical one and the fleet
# syncs FROM here, verbatim). excalidraw.2plot.dev and modelviewer.2plot.dev
# were deliberately absent until they deployed; both went live in the gate
# wave (2026-08-21/22, verified via /healthz build identity) and joined in
# 1.6.5. The fleet re-copy carries them to every satellite's directory.
